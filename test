Focused, fit and fast
1) Ensure Infrastructure Platforms and Products are updated and maintained in line with risk appetite and vendor roadmaps - 

Kollective - Ensure platform is handed over to BAU support with the latest updates, that the user guide reflects the current deployment status and 3rd parties are clear on the net steps. 
RHEL8 - Continue to support the automation of RHEL8 using Ansible/Terraform/Packer. Cont
RHEL9 - Continue to support the roadmap for delivering RHEL9
Patch Automation - Lead the patch automation function to deliver automated patching on RHEL8+, with the hope of moving it to RHEL7
AppviewX - Support the build team in delivering AppViewX updates using RHEL8 and Containerization

2) Fulfil all regulatory responsibilities, ensuring timely management of all audits, oversight and controls testing actions 

Design/Implementation of the Kollective Project included Pen testing, CIS testing and User testing to ensure the system was secure and met the regulatory benchmarks NBS expect

What are the activities you will carry out to achieve this outcome? - Personalise to make relevant

Regular meetings with the Project teams

Keeping my skills relevant in the technologies

Regularly communicate issues being faced, and work with colleagues to overcome those issues

Work on soft skills to increase my effectiveness in leading and getting results from collaborations

How will you know when you’re successful? 

Depending on the project/work success is measured in different ways, if it's a dedicated piece of project work then success is generally when AIS is accepted and the BAU teams have take ownership of the work. To get this far you've architected, designed, built, tested and remediated any issues.

I always embrace automation first. Automation along with IaC should play a huge part in any new projects, it promotes consistency, speed of the initial deployment but most importantly allows us to get products to our customers quickly. 

As a snr Tech I need to demonstrate these behaviours by including automation in all of the designs/documents I produce but as a manager by encouraging my team to embrace automation first and pushing them to think about the current infrastructure and how we can automate it.

What are the activities you will carry out to achieve this outcome? - Personalise to make relevant

While my work doesn't directly influence the delivery of HLZ (Yet) the work I do with my team on the delivery of automated VMs to be deployed onto HLZ in the RHEL space and the content delivery service Satellite plays in allowing the successful deployment and patching of those VMs will effect the success of the platform.

Development goal
################
We all need to think about our own learning and development. This may be exploring new opportunities, taking on new experiences or keeping skills up to date for your role. We need to continuously push for better and take responsibility of our own personal development. Things to consider (but not limited too) when deciding your outcome are: What development is relevant to both myself and my role? What skills do I need to fulfil my role? What will make the biggest impact to both myself and my performance? What are my team's deliverables and where are my gaps? How will this contribute towards our strategy? - Personalise to make relevant.
#################
I'm a strong advocate of personal development, not only because it helps you in your current role but because in this fast moving market your skills become stale unless you're moving forward!

I'm currently studying for the HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate (003) qualification and hope to sit the exam in around two months. 

I'd also like to renew my AWS certified architect exam having previously sat it in 2017

Architectural Design
Consumed Patterns
Data Flow
Access and Security
Groups to be requested
