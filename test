Automation is a fundamental principle that I consistently prioritize. In any new project, I firmly believe that automation, coupled with Infrastructure as Code (IaC), should play a pivotal role. By leveraging automation, we not only foster consistency in our processes but also expedite the initial deployment phase. Moreover, it enables us to deliver products to our customers with remarkable speed, ensuring swift and efficient outcomes. Embracing automation empowers us to streamline operations, enhance productivity, and effectively respond to the ever-changing demands of our customers.

Get it done

1) Deliver the approved business case and realisation of benefits for the Hosting Landing Zone project
2) Deliver the Strategic Investment Outcomes in the FY23/24 ECR; on time, on budget and to the agreed scope and benefits
################
What are the activities you will carry out to achieve this outcome? - Personalise to make relevant

While my work doesn't directly influence the delivery of HLZ (Yet) the work I do with my team on the delivery of automated VMs to be deployed onto HLZ in the RHEL space and the content delivery service Satellite plays in allowing the successful deployment and patching of those VMs will effect the success of the platform.

Development goal
################
We all need to think about our own learning and development. This may be exploring new opportunities, taking on new experiences or keeping skills up to date for your role. We need to continuously push for better and take responsibility of our own personal development. Things to consider (but not limited too) when deciding your outcome are: What development is relevant to both myself and my role? What skills do I need to fulfil my role? What will make the biggest impact to both myself and my performance? What are my team's deliverables and where are my gaps? How will this contribute towards our strategy? - Personalise to make relevant.
#################
I'm a strong advocate of personal development, not only because it helps you in your current role but because in this fast moving market your skills become stale unless you're moving forward!

I'm currently studying for the HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate (003) qualification and hope to sit the exam in around two months. 

I'd also like to renew my AWS certified architect exam having previously sat it in 2017
